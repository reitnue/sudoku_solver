Starting this log. Have a data structure for the game and initial methods.

Wrote a tester -> human first backtracking is doing really well over all difficulties.

Hypothesized that its edge over the backtracking algo would decrease with difficulty, but i guess not. Might be because at higher difficulties a single extra number adds so much more information than before for easier difficulties.

wrote solver to mix in human solving after guessing. I believe that as the boards are harder the better performing this method does against just heuristic then backtracking, because the resulting search space is still large and heuristics help cut them down.
