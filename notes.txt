- has step by step solutions
- has additional methods that I don't think i have implemented

use to generate sudokus of different levels

# Solvers
[x] Human Solver then Backtrack
[x] priority Backtracking
	[ ] even more - depending on the related squares and their priorities
	[ ] start with most or least opportunity?
	[ ] random
[x] random backtracking

[ ] probabilistic backtracking
- a probability to the choice of a number in each box
- choosing the number within the box instead of the box for the number
[ ] cell weightings to improve guessing

[x] Backtracking with human solving until nothing can be done then continue backtracking
[x] add priorities to cells/numbers - not clean, because constantly updating
[~] how many guesses metric
- uniform weighting of guess percentage vs. total guesses/total empty (this deweights the small number of guesses, regardless of how many empty there are)
[ ] double row - heuristic
[ ] conditional checking heuristic after any fill ins

# Testers
[x] variance/std dev
[x] run solver on each board multiple times
[ ] t test

# Extensions
[ ] 16x16 and so on...
	[ ] board generation
